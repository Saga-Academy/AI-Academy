# AI Training Academy - Text-to-Video Master Prompt

## Module: Text-to-Video (RunwayML / Pika Labs Style)

### **The Cinematic Masterpiece Prompt Formula**

Use the following structure for maximum visual impact and control:

[SCENE DESCRIPTION], [ACTION/MOVEMENT], [STYLE/AESTHETICS], [CAMERA WORK], [TECHNICAL PARAMETERS]

### **Prompt Example 1 (Hyper-Realistic Sci-Fi):**

A chrome robot, reflective surface, standing on a sand dune at sunset. The robot is slowly raising its head to look at the massive ringed planet on the horizon.
**STYLE:** Hyper-detailed, photorealistic, cinematic, soft volumetric lighting, warm golden hour tones.
**CAMERA:** Ultra-wide shot, slow 360-degree orbit around the robot, shallow depth of field.
**TECHNICAL:** 4K, 24fps, high motion coherence.

### **Prompt Example 2 (Abstract & Dreamy):**

Abstract watercolor painting of a giant whale swimming through a dense purple fog. The fog dissipates into swirling pink bokeh lights.
**STYLE:** Watercolor illustration, soft edges, ethereal, dreamlike quality, highly textured paper background.
**MOVEMENT:** Whale slowly turns, the fog gently drifts across the screen.
**TECHNICAL:** Low motion scale, focus on color flow.

### **Actionable Tip:**

If the video result is too chaotic, reduce the "motion scale" or the number of moving elements in your prompt. Focus on one main action per generation.
