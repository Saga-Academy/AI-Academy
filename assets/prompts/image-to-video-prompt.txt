# AI Training Academy - Image-to-Video Master Prompt

## Module: Image-to-Video Transformation (e.g., RunDiffusion, Pika Labs, Gen-2 Motion Brush)

### **The Golden Rule for Image-to-Video:**

Your goal is to describe the **desired motion** and **camera shift**, NOT the original image content. The AI already sees the image.

### **Prompt Section 1: Describing the Motion Mask (Motion Brush)**

This section is crucial if you are using a mask or brush tool to define a region of motion. The prompt should reinforce the specific action on the masked area.

**Targeted Motion Prompts (Use on Masked Areas):**

1.  **Water/Fluid:** The clear, reflective water surface gently ripples and flows rapidly towards the right, catching the morning sunlight.
2.  **Smoke/Fog:** The heavy, low-lying fog slowly lifts and swirls upward, dissipating into the bright sky.
3.  **Hair/Cloth:** The model’s long red hair blows dynamically in a strong wind coming from the upper left. The silk cloak billows and snaps behind her.
4.  **Fire/Energy:** Intense magical energy pulses outwards from the object's center, releasing shimmering sparks that quickly fade into the air.
5.  **Growth/Change:** The delicate green vines slowly twist and climb up the stone column, sprouting tiny white flowers along the path.

### **Prompt Section 2: Camera and Environment Dynamics (Global Motion)**

This section controls the overall movement of the virtual camera and background elements not controlled by the mask.

**Camera Movement (Use for subtle cinematic feel):**

* **Zoom/Pan:** Slow, continuous cinematic zoom in on the subject's face, increasing tension.
* **Rotation:** Gentle, almost imperceptible 5-degree counter-clockwise rotation, giving an unnerving effect.
* **Dolly Shot:** The camera slowly tracks forward through the dense jungle canopy.
* **Tilt/Angle:** Slow vertical tilt downward, revealing the canyon floor below the subject.

**Environmental Movement (If not masked):**

* The distant clouds drift across the pale blue sky at a steady pace.
* The large leaves on the trees sway softly in a warm summer breeze.
* Subtle rainfall begins to gently mist the window glass in the foreground.

### **Prompt Section 3: Negative Prompts (What to Avoid)**

Use these to maintain coherence and prevent common artifacts or stylistic drift.

* `--NO motion blur, low quality, warping, excessive distortion, glitching, morphing, frame rate drops, pixelation, blurry background.`
* `--NO stylistic change, do not add watercolor effect, do not change the subject’s expression.`

### **Prompt Synthesis Example:**

**Original Image:** A close-up of a medieval knight standing still in front of a ruined castle wall.

**Final, Combined Image-to-Video Prompt:**

`The wind catches the knight's silk banner, causing it to flap wildly. Dense, grey smoke drifts slowly off the ruins. Slow push-in cinematic zoom on the knight. --NO warping, low quality, face distortion.`

### **Actionable Tip for Length:**

While longer prompts can be more descriptive, for Image-to-Video, **precision beats length**. Prioritize high-impact verbs (e.g., "billows," "ripples," "twists") over long descriptive adjectives.
